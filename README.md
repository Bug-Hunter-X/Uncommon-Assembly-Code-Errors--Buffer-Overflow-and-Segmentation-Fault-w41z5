This repository demonstrates two uncommon but critical errors that can occur in assembly code: buffer overflow and segmentation fault.  The `bug.asm` file showcases code vulnerable to these errors. The `bugSolution.asm` file provides corrected code with appropriate input validation and memory address checks, preventing these vulnerabilities. These examples highlight the importance of rigorous error handling and input validation in low-level programming to ensure security and stability.
